My goal for the Fall 2024 semester as a first year MCS student is to broaden my software development and machine learning skillset in as many ways as possible. This includes becoming more familiar with many python Machine Learning libraries as well as improving my ability to write and deploy applications to cloud services. I also hope to just become more generally comfortable working with different varied technologies and broadening my skillset with those technologies. To accomplish these goals I plan to take a broad set of courses that expose me to a multitude of specialized fields within CS while still somewhat focusing on data science and machine learning concepts as that is my primary area of interest. While taking these courses I also hope to continue developing my skills in basic algorithm solving and code writing so as to develop as varied a skillset as possible. I also want to stay up to date with state of the art software libraries related to attention mechanisms and deep learning concepts as I believe this is the future of DS/ML.
